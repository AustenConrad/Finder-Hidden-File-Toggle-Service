=== Install ===

Install as a Mac OS X service by moving the Toggle Hidden File Visibility.workflow folder to:
[your home directory]/Library/Services/Toggle Hidden File Visibility.workflow

NOTE: Remember a .workflow file looks like a folder on github, but Mac OS X treats it as a bundled file.


==== Usage ====

When in a Finder window, go to the top menu and select:

	Finder => Services => Toggle Hidden File Visibility

NOTE: If you're in a 'Open file' dialog you will need to use the following keyboard shortcut instead (it's built into OS X):
	Command + Shift + .
